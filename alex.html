                            To show what I have done in school as well as in my pet projects outside of school. 
                            The abilities I have and the things I can do shall all be displayed here. 
                            What I enjoy to do the most is 3D modeling using Maya and Blender, but I can do much more than that. 
                            As you will see.</p>

                                    This is a drawing I made of a bird using only charcoal. 
                                    This Piece was my final project for one of my art classes and it took me about 2 weeks to complete from start to finish. 
                                    I decided to put this in my portfolio to show my general artistic ability, as well as demonstrate my commitment and attention to detail.

                                    This piece is a hawaiian shirt that I textured and painted in Substance Painter. 
                                    This was actually part of a more detailed project where I was demonstrating cloth physics in Autodesk MAYA. 
                                    This wasn't a project assigned to me; it was something that I was interested in learning myself. 
                                    I modeled and textured everything myself before I animated and ran the cloth simulation.

                                    This wine glass I made was also another personal project I made. 
                                    I was curious on how to make transparent objects in MAYA so I watched a couple youtube turotials and made this.
                                    It was really interesting because I had to calculate the refraction index of wine in order to make the liguid inside of the glass appear as realistic as possible.
                                    Also, the reflections in the glass are traced and accurately reflect the environment as if the glass were really inside of that room.

                                    This piece is another one that I textured in Substance Painter; 
                                    modeled, rigged, and animated in Maya. 
                                    This is a mummy that I am going to put into a VR game that I am developing on my own.
                                    I wanted to make the mummy somewhat graphic and scary because that is the theme of my game.

                                    This is a palm tree that I made using MAYA, Substance Painter, and Unity. 
                                    I really wanted to make this tree have a lot of texture because my game environment is going to be filled with variations of this tree.
                                    I also wanted to add lots of textures to get more experience and practice using Substance Painter.
                                    You can even see veins in the leaves of the tree if you look closely.

                                        I am a University student at Boise State University in the GIMM (Gaming, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technologies) Major. 
                                        I'm Idahoan, but I plan to move to Italy and work as a 3D Modeler there, as well as work on the family vineyard.

                                        4 years ago, I tried out Blender in an attempt to make a custom VRChat avatar. 
                                        This was before I had a VR headset and was playing on my laptop I got for a graduation gift; 
                                        but I enjoyed it so much that ever since then I've done 3d Modeling on and off for pet projects.

                                        Another dream of mine is to become a pilot. 
                                        Here is a picture of me about to go on a solo flights where I was tasked to take off and land 3 times by myself.
